Title: Software Security Analysis of Ethereum Smart Contracts
Author: Nicolas Schapeler
--- Summary ---
The paper introduces software security analysis tools for the programming lanugage Solidity which
is used to write smart contracts for the Ethereum protocol.
A brief overview over Ethereum and common errors in Solidity is given. Different approaches to
the security analysis are then introduced which are seperated into static, dynamic and testing
approaches.
Four of the introduced approaches are lastly compared based on their execution speed in regard to
the number of checked vulnerabilities.
The paper is well structured and written. It is easy to understand even without knowledge about the
topic.
--- Notes ---
1) Throughout the paper, only the last name of one author is used to refer to a paper, although it was
written by multiple authors. As far as I know, „et al.“ should be added after the last name of the first
author.
2) For Reference Nr. 6-9 and Nr. 20 there is some information missing. Reference 43 also has some
problems regarding the website address.
3) In my opinion, some information written in the footnotes could be put into the main text.
4) The introduction of abbreviations is somewhat inconsistent. DoS as a abbreviation for Denial of
Service for example is not officially introduced until Section 3.2.2 but is used in eariler sections.
Some abbreviations are also introduced although the term is only used once in the paper.
5) One citiation is broken in each Section 3.1.2, 3.1.3 and 3.4.1.
6) There are some periods missing, especially after footnotes.
